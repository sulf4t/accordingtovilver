{"name":"Accordingtovilver","tagline":"My blog","body":"### If someone \r\nhad told me that today would be the day that I would write an article, I would not have believed them.\r\nAs I am typing this, I'm cooking my ‘super-duper oatmeal breakfast’ (A nice tutorial of how to cook this super breakfast will be available soon). \r\n\r\nBy the way, if you think I'm writing in my room in front of my computer, you could not be more wrong. I just grabbed my phone - as I was previously listening to RnB hip-hop mixes from ‘Google music’ (Nana Trey songs then Gold Digger by Kanye West) - and then started typing this text...\r\nAt this moment, I'm just trying to take a screenshot of my cellphone, but I have this new Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone (from work) that makes it impossible to do so (however, after 2 days, I just realized I had been doing it wrong this whole time. See, you have to click both the home and power buttons at the same time).\r\n\r\nWell, it's been more than a year I started to motivate myself. I always find a way to do things I needed to do, even if initially I did not want to do them. I’ve wanted to start blogging for more than 6 months now in order to help those who are unsuccessful at getting what they want, bored and too comfortable with life. I want to help give people the push they need to achieve things they never thought they could. In other words, to get YOU out of your highly unsuccessful, bored but comfortable life...\r\n\r\n### To be honest, \r\nI was afraid to write this article...\r\nIt reminds me of this exercise I did a few months ago. I read it from a ‘comfort zone crusher’, which is a website that helps you crush your comfort zone and gain confidence. For 14 days you have to do some drills like lay down on a crowded street for a minute. \r\nI still remember that moment, I was literally frozen when I was about to do it... \r\nMy heart was beating fast, so fast, as if I was going to die. I couldn’t move, I was watching everyone around me; there were so many people! \r\n\r\nSo many thoughts were running through my mind : What are they thinking? Are they talking about me? Do they think I’m crazy ? Will they just stop and watch me, mock me, as they point and laugh ? Will they angrily say : \"Moron, have a life and go work !\"?\r\n\r\n### I faced my fear ! \r\nThere will come a time in your life when you will confront your fears face to face. In that moment it is you who will decide what comes of that confrontation. You have only two options when it comes to facing your fears: It's you or it’s him. You beat it or it beats you. You win or you lose. You eat it or you will be eaten. There is no in between. You must realize that each time you eat your fear; you have a higher chance of eating it again next time.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you let it wins, you can be doomed ! Let's try to see this scenario : \r\nDo you remember the cute girl you saw in the bus or while at the grocery store ? She was in front of you, she gave you a glance, she smiled, and you said to yourself: \"Damn, I should go talk to her\". But then fear shows up and you let it beat you. A few minutes later, she walks away and you regret not talking to her for the days and weeks to come. \r\nIt will soon become a pattern, every time this situation occurs, you will run like a coward and never go forward with your life. You will be stuck at in the same place. \r\n\r\n### After so many minutes, I chose to beat it.\r\nAs I lay down on the street, I felt my fear of being judged vanish. I realized how \"easy\" it was. I mean, nothing wrong happened... people around me didn't care, they just looked at me for few seconds and then continued on with their lives as if nothing happened. \r\nTwo or three people stopped and asked me if was alright. I told them I was good and they just left.\r\nFear vanished and a feeling of pride filled my heart. \r\nI was in a euphoric state, the same state you feel after completing that difficult level of your favorite game, like the last Super Metroid boss in the Super Nintendo!\r\n\r\nThat's the feeling I am experiencing right now, at this very moment. It is this pride feeling, you experience soon after you've finally jumped into this cold water and you realize how foolish, no, how a cowardly you were for not doing it sooner. \r\n\r\nHere it is, this is how I did it. Only you know how that will sounds, but you'll have to \"just do it\" and \"beat it\" !\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know yet where this blog is going. Only time will tell. In the meantime, let me know what it is you fear? Will this fear prevent you from doing what you need to do to accomplish success?","google":"UA-75012592-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
